# üç£ MakiMongo

MakiMongo is a lightweight wrapper around the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) client for Node,
which gives you utilities like validation and batching without the overhead of a full ODM/ORM.

## üõ† Installation

With npm:

```sh
npm install @movefast-llc/maki-mongo
```

With yarn:

```sh
yarn add @movefast-llc/maki-mongo
```

## üöÄ Quick start

MakiMongo is designed to work best with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but it also
works well with plain JavaScript.

With TypeScript:

```typescript
// Zod is used for object schema validation
import * as z from "zod"
import { Document, wrapCollection, connect, disconnect } from "@movefast-llc/maki-mongo"

// MakiMongo works by wrapping each MongoDB collection
// First, this is the basic schema which documents in this collection are expected to follow
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
})

// Next, we define the TypeScript definition of what this collection contains
// Note that Document provides _id, createdAt and updatedAt fields so the schema doesn't need to include these
type Thing = Document & z.infer<typeof schema>

// Now we wrap the collection, passing in the type and the schema
const thingsCollection = wrapCollection<Thing>("things", {
  schema,
  // Indexes will be created (if they don't exist) during the connection process
  indexes: [{ key: { name: 1 } }]
})

connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/maki-mongo-basic").then(async () => {
  // Now this call is validated both with TypeScript and at runtime with Zod
  await thingsCollection.createDocument({ name: "one", age: 10 })

  await disconnect()
})
```

Without TypeScript:

```js
const z = require("zod")
const { wrapCollection, connect, disconnect } = require("@movefast-llc/maki-mongo")

// This is the same as the previous example, minus the type definitions
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string()
})

const thingsCollection = wrapCollection("things", {
  schema,
  indexes: [{ key: { name: 1 } }]
})

connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/maki-mongo-basic").then(async () => {
  // This call is validated at runtime with Zod
  await thingsCollection.createDocument({ name: "one", age: 10 })

  await disconnect()
})
```

## Top-level method overview

```typescript
import MakiMongo from "@movefast-llc/maki-mongo"

// Wraps a collection for use with MakiMongo - see below
MakiMongo.wrapCollection(name, { schema, indexes })
// Connects to a database. This MUST be awaited before you do any database operations
MakiMongo.connect(url)
// Disconnects from the current database
MakiMongo.disconnect()
// Disconnects if connected, then connects to another database
MakiMongo.reconnect(url)
// Returns the current MongoClient if connected
MakiMongo.currentClient()
// Returns the current Db if connected
MakiMongo.currentDb()
// Checks whether a connection has been established yet
MakiMongo.isConnected()
// Creates a new client manager with all the above methods (see "Multiple databases")
MakiMongo.createClient()
```

## Collection method overview

‚ÑπÔ∏è All non-deprecated methods on `Collection` from the MongoDB driver are available on wrapped
collections. See http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.5/api/Collection.html

However, since these methods are forwarded straight from the base driver, there's **no validation** -
use the additional methods provided by the wrapper to validate documents.

```typescript
const collection = MakiMongo.wrapCollection(...)

// This kind of thing delegates straight to the MongoDB driver
collection.find(query, options?)
collection.distinct(query, options?)
// ... you get the picture

// These use dataloader to batch queries (anything executed in the same "tick")
// Useful for things like GraphQL resolvers
collection.findById(id)
collection.findById(ids)

// Creates a document *and validates it against the schema*
collection.createDocument(document)

// Updates a document. Simple fields in $set are validated, but complex updates are not
collection.updateDocument(document, { ... })

// Updates a document with full validation
// This works by inserting the updated document into a temporary collection first, so it's much slower the non-validated way
collection.updateDocument(document, { ... }, { fullValidate: true })

// Deletes one or more documents
collection.deleteDocument(document)
collection.deleteDocuments(documents)

// Checks if a document matching the query exists
collection.exists(query)

// Processes documents in batches to avoid loading everything into memory at once
// Useful for data migration scripts and any analysis that can't be done with aggregation
collection.processInBatches({ batchSize?, query?, process })

// Returns the base Collection object, in case you want to do something more low-level
collection.mongoCollection
```

## Multiple databases

You can connect to multiple databases at once by creating multiple client managers with the
`createClient` method.

```typescript
const one = MakiMongo.createClient()
const two = MakiMongo.createClient()

const collectionOne = one.wrapCollection("games")
const collectionTwo = two.wrapCollection("apps")

async function main() {
  await one.connect("http://localhost:27017/games_db")
  await two.connect("http://localhost:27017/apps_db")

  await collectionOne.find() // Run against games_db
  await collectionTwo.find() // Run against apps_db
}
```
